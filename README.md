# Terraform + Kubernetes the hard way

1. [Kubernetes the hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way), except we will be using AWS + Terraform to set up our infra for this. The tutorial follows GCP + terminal commands.

2. This costs $5.50 a day to run, or $0.23 per hour. This exceeds the free tier.

3. Use Terraform to set-up/ tear-down infra on the fly because manually destorying resources is a pain, considering this costs money to operate.
