# Terraform + Kubernetes the hard way

1. [Kubernetes the hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way), except we will be using AWS + Terraform to set up our infra for this. The tutorial follows GCP + terminal commands.

2. This costs $5.50 a day to run, or $0.23 per hour. Use terraform instead so you not only save money, but also automate the manual parts of the infra set up.
